# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
  In this project, the goal was to optimize charitable investment for a ficticious company, AlphabetSoup. To accomplish this, a dataset containing information about over 30,000 charities was subjected to a deep learning binary classifier, to bifurcate the data into charaties worth investing in and those that are not (encoded as 1 and 0 respectively). Before training, the data was subjected to preprocessing in the form of noisy feature removal and scaling. Following compilation, training, and evaluation, the model was optimized with extra neurons, extra hidden layers, and alternative activation functions.
